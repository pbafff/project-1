        from the students
        of the
        2001 - 2002
        SIAST Kelsey Campus
        Literacy Program
        Preface
        The family unit is the key to the success of any family literacy program. It is through the
        family that the seeds of literacy grow. The impact of the parent-child interactions
        establishes and nurtures the importance of literacy.
        The role of the parent as a model cannot be under- estimated. It is through modeling that
        the child establishes lifetime patterns. Initially the child imitates the modeled behaviors and
        eventually adopts these behaviors.
        When parents read to their children it assigns a positive value to literacy. Not only are the
        parents showing the child that reading is a good thing, but the parent also experiences the
        positive reinforcement of developing his or her own skills.
        The promotion and encouragement of family literacy is one of the mandates of the SIAST
        Kelsey Campus Literacy Program. In our endeavors to achieve this the students of the
        2001/2002 literacy class have created this children's storybook. This book will be used by
        the students within their own home environments, and with their own family and extended
        family units in the spirit of family literacy.
        The children's storybook Bedtime Stories was completed and launched as part of our classes
        celebration of Family Literacy Day 2002. The book was a success. Our critics, the children,
        grandchildren, nieces and nephews of our students gave very positive reviews.
        Past literacy students reported, with pride, that their children have enjoyed and continue to
        enjoy the student generated stories and graphics of past books composed by our literacy
        class. Some of the students reported that their children wanted to hear each selection in the
        book at one reading.
        The children's reactions to previous books have become a major motivation for the
        development of Bedtime Stories.
        A multiple intelligence approach was used in the creation and development of both
        children's books. The Multiple Intelligence model once again has lent itself well to this task.
        Multiple intelligence is an educational model that allows the students to approach a given
        task by using as many as eight different intelligence approaches. The tasks involved in the
        creation of theses books allowed each student to approach the challenge through his or her
        preferred intelligence(s) and at the same time develop and strengthen those intelligences
        that are less developed.
        The process of creating a student generated children's book has been a very positive
        experience. It not only allows the students a sense of ownership, it allows the growth of
        pride in that ownership. It has allowed the students to safely and successfully take a risk.
        For most of the students this challenge has opened the doors to areas of reading and
        literacy that they had not previously experienced: creativity, imagination and success. The
        students are now demonstrating the courage to take risks in their reading and writing.
